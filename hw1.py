### Problem 1
###

print "Problem 1 solution follows:"

a= 1
b= -5.86
c= 8.5408
x= (-b + math.sqrt (b*b - (4*a*c))) / (2*a)
y= (-b - math.sqrt (b*b - (4*a*c))) / (2*a)
print "the first root is"
print x
print "the second root is"
print y



###
### Problem 2
###

print "Problem 2 solution follows:"

import hw1_test

print hw1_test.a
print hw1_test.b
print hw1_test.c
print hw1_test.d
print hw1_test.e
print hw1_test.f


###
### Problem 3
###

print "Problem 3 solution follows:"

if ((hw1_test.a and hw1_test.b) or (not hw1_test.c) and not (hw1_1.d or hw1_1.e or hw1_1.f)):
	print "true"
else :
	print "false"
